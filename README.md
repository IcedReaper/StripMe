# StripMe!

StripMe is a Fabric Mod for Minecraft 1.16 on the Base of World Stripper Fabric by EwyBoy.

I used his Code, adapted it for Minecraft 1.16 and simplified it a bunch.
The Configuration is temporary deactivated and everything is hardcoded for the purpose of getting the mod to run.

All credit goes out to EwyBoy. Check him out here on Github or on Twitch.
